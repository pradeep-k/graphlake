# Heterogenous Graph Data
A framework for dynamic graphs containing diverse types of entities and relationships. 

It is currently working with some limitations. I have tested it on LUBM, LDBC, and LANL data sets.

More help will be provided soon, meanwhile feel free to contact me, if you plan to use this software.
